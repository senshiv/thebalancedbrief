As managers, we are trained to resolve conflicts **within teams**, but what happens when the tension lies **between the manager and a more experienced team member**?  

This situation is more common than it seems — especially in **cross-functional teams**, **tech-driven environments**, or during **organizational transitions**. The manager may feel threatened, challenged, or even undermined. And the experienced team member may resist direction, question decisions, or act independently.

So how should a manager approach this — not just externally, but internally?

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Acknowledge the Internal Conflict

The first step is honest self-reflection. Are you feeling:
- Insecure about your authority?
- Intimidated by the other’s expertise?
- Frustrated by perceived resistance?

Identifying these emotions doesn’t weaken leadership — it **strengthens it** by allowing objective decision-making.

---

## 🤝 Step 2: Separate Ego from Impact

Remember: **seniority ≠ insubordination**. A more experienced teammate might be used to autonomy or feel protective about legacy systems or past success.  

Ask:
> “Is this a case of disrespect, or just difference in working style?”

Approach them with **curiosity, not confrontation**.

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Use Coaching Conversation Techniques

Instead of positional authority, use **coaching-style questions**:
- “What do you think is the best way forward?”
- “How do you see this aligning with team goals?”
- “Where do you think we’re diverging?”

This **de-escalates tension** and positions the team member as a valued contributor, not a rival.

## 🧭 Step 4: Reframe Your Role

As a manager, your job isn’t to be the smartest person in the room. It’s to:
- Enable collaboration  
- Align diverse strengths  
- Guide outcomes, not micro-manage process  

If the experienced team member has deeper technical knowledge — **leverage it**, don’t suppress it.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Set Boundaries with Respect

Mutual respect doesn’t mean avoiding structure. Be clear about:
- Roles and responsibilities  
- Decision-making authority  
- How disagreements will be resolved

It’s perfectly reasonable to say:
> “I value your input. Ultimately, I’m accountable for this delivery, so we need alignment on this approach.”

---

## 💡 Conclusion

Conflict with a more experienced team member is not a threat — it’s an opportunity to practice **adaptive leadership**, emotional maturity, and confidence without ego.  

When managed well, these situations build trust, elevate team performance, and make you a better leader — not just a manager.

Gardening and Agile might seem like worlds apart — one rooted in soil, the other in sprints. But tending to a small garden this summer unexpectedly offered me valuable lessons in **project management**, **iteration**, and **resilience**.

## 1. You Can’t Plan Everything Up Front

Just like in Agile, no matter how much you plan your garden layout, unexpected variables show up: too much rain, pest attacks, poor soil. Similarly, projects evolve. Requirements shift, constraints emerge. Agile prepares you to respond, not resist.

## 2. Small, Regular Work Beats One-Time Effort

A garden needs regular care: watering, pruning, weeding. Miss a few days and you lose momentum. The same applies to Agile sprints — progress depends on **consistency**, not bursts.

## 3. Feedback Loops Matter

You don’t wait till harvest to evaluate. You inspect plants weekly: Are they growing? Wilting? Agile retrospectives and stand-ups are your feedback loops. Inspect and adapt.

## 4. Every Sprint (or Season) Teaches You Something

Even a failed crop isn’t a waste. You learn what to do better next time. Agile thrives on this mindset — **fail fast, learn faster**.

## 5. Joy in Growth, Not Just Output

Gardening taught me that growth is often invisible until it’s not. Just because you can’t see sprint outcomes immediately doesn’t mean value isn’t compounding.
